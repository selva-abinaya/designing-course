       <u>What is the history of PostgreSQL</u><br><br>
The PostgreSQL project started in 1986 under the direction of Professor Michael Stonebreaker at the University of California, Berkeley.<br> The project was originally named POSTGRES,<br> in reference to the older Ingres database, also developed at Berkeley. POSTGRES aimed to add the fewest features needed to completely support multiple data types.

In 1996, <br>the project was renamed PostgreSQL to illustrate its support for the SQL querying language (although PostgreSQL is still commonly abbreviated as Postgres).<br> A dedicated and diverse community of contributors—the PostgreSQL Global Development Group—continues to make regular major and minor releases of the free and open-source database project.

<u>What are the benefits of using PostgreSQL</u><br><br>
PostgreSQL has a rich history of supporting advanced data types. <br>It supports a level of performance optimization that is common across its commercial database counterparts,<br> like Oracle and SQL Server. Read more benefits below.

<br><u>Rich features and extensions</u><br><br>
PostgreSQL possesses robust feature sets, including tablespaces, asynchronous replication,<br> nested transactions, online/hot backups, and a refined query planner/optimizer.<br> The PostgreSQL community has also developed extensions that extend the functionality of PostgreSQL database.<br><br> PostgreSQL supports:<br>

International character sets, multi-byte character encodings, and Unicode. <br>
Most SQL:2008 data types, including INTEGER, NUMERIC, BOOLEAN, CHAR, VARCHAR, DATE, INTER-VAL, and TIMESTAMP.<br>
Storage of large binary objects, including pictures, sounds, video, and maps.<br>
Foreign keys, joins, views, triggers, and stored procedures.<br>
Leading programming languages and protocols,<br> including Python, Java, Perl, .Net, Go, Ruby, C/C++, Tcl, and ODBC.<br>
It is locale-aware for sorting, case sensitivity, and formatting.<br> The PostgreSQL database server is highly scalable both in the quantity of data it can manage and in the number of concurrent users it can accommodate.<br>
