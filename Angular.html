    <p><u>What is AngularJS</u>
  <br>      AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps.<br> It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly.<br> AngularJS's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write.<br>
